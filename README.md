# MNIST Classification with CI/CD Pipeline

This project implements a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for MNIST digit classification with a complete CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. The model architecture includes two convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers, optimized to have less than 25000 parameters while maintaining > 95% accuracy.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- pytest

## Local Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

On Windows
```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
On macOS/Linux
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the dependencies:
```
pip install torch torchvision pytest
```

## Running Locally

1. Train the model:
```
python train.py
```
This will:
- Download the MNIST dataset (if not already present)
- Train the model for one epoch
- Save the model with a timestamp (format: `mnist_model_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.pth`)

2. Run tests:
```
pytest test_model.py -v
```
This will verify:
- Model architecture (input/output dimensions)
- Parameter count (< 25000)
- Model accuracy (> 95%)

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically:
1. Sets up a Python environment
2. Installs dependencies
3. Trains the model
4. Runs all tests
5. Saves the trained model as an artifact

The pipeline runs automatically on every push to the repository.

## Model Architecture

The CNN architecture consists of:
- Input layer: 28x28 grayscale images
- Conv1: 8 filters (3x3)
- Conv2: 16 filters (3x3)
- Max Pooling layers
- Two Fully Connected layers
- Output: 10 classes (digits 0-9)

Total parameters: ~52,138

## Deployment

Models are automatically saved with timestamps for versioning:
- Format: `mnist_model_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.pth`
- Location: Project root directory
- Artifacts: Available in GitHub Actions after successful runs

## Notes

- The model is optimized for CPU training
- Training is limited to one epoch for quick testing
- Accuracy requirements might need adjustment based on your specific needs
- Model artifacts are automatically saved in GitHub Actions
